# Minecraft World Checker

Insperated by [Fenixin/Minecraft-Region-Fixer](https://github.com/Fenixin/Minecraft-Region-Fixer), but a optimized commandline usage, and integration to your backup Process.

This Tool has different output formats, ```commandline``` and ```Yaml```.

The Yaml format can used for fixing the corrupted files.

You can analys a set of worlds or a single Minecraft File.

```bash
mcworldmanager -v worlds ~/repos-ansible/minecraft-server-project-repos/docker_compose-world-maps/worldfolder/world
```

```bash
mcworldmanager region ~/repos-ansible/minecraft-server-project-repos/docker_compose-world-maps/worldfolder/world_flat/region/r.1.1.mca
```
